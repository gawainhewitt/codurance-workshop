We are using Tone.js for sound and P5.js for images today. 

I have tried to keep this repo as simple as possible to keep things playful. 

### Tone.js

This is an excellent library and very well documented. The documentation does assume music and sound engineering knowledge however. Please do ask me if you want anything explained. 

I have accessed the library with a CDN for this session to make this easy. You can see the link for this in the head of the html file. Normally I would install it using NPM.
